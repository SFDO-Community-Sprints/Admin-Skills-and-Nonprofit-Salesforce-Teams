### Project Name
Admin Skills and Nonprofit Salesforce Team Roles

### Project Theme
Develop models for Salesforce team structures within nonprofit organizations. Catalog resources for effective CRM leadership in nonprofits beyond what is covered within certification materials. For use by Salesforce Administrators, C-Level Nonprofit Executives, and SI Partners.

### Project Vertical
Nonprofits + staffing. (But almost all of what we're working on could be extrapolated to any Salesforce team environment, it's just that we are aiming to write from a nonprofit-specific lens to be most helpful to our community.)
