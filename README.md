### Project Name
Admin Skills and Nonprofit Salesforce Team Roles

### Project Theme
Supporting admins + their supervisors in forming strong Salesforce teams. We're currently generating and collating best practice documentation on soft skills related to this role.

Almost all of what we're working on could be extrapolated to any Salesforce team environment, it's just that we are aiming to write from a nonprofit-specific lens to be most helpful to our community.
