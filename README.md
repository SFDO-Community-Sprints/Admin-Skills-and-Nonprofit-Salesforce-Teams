### Project Vision

Develop standardized System Admin and Business Analyst job descriptions and build alignment around them throughout the SFDO ecosystem (customers, consultants, etc). Develop models for Salesforce team structures within nonprofit organizations. Catalog resources for effective CRM leadership in nonprofits beyond what is covered within certification materials. For use by Salesforce Administrators, C-Level Nonprofit Executives, and SI Partners.

### Project Resources (It's ok if you'd prefer to type all the things in Google docs, Quip, or your word processor of choice, just please make sure you include links to your work here in Github. We need a source of truth, and for now that's here in GitHub.)
* Indicate if there are any existing Hub Ideas, or product Issues/Bugs that you're solving for. 
* Where can we find additional information on your project? Ie. do you have supporting code in another Repo, do you have documentation in Google, your repo's Wiki, etc.? Be sure to include (or at least links to) all supporting material here. If it's not in your project Repo, it will get lost.
