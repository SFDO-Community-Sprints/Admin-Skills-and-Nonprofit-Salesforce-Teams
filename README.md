### Project Name
Admin Skills and Nonprofit Salesforce Team Roles

### Project Goals
Support admins + their supervisors in forming strong Salesforce teams. Generate and collate best practice documentation on soft skills related to this role.

Almost all of what we're working on could be extrapolated to any Salesforce team environment, it's just that we are aiming to write from a nonprofit-specific lens to be most helpful to our community. Our next steps as a group are motivated by the needs we feel from our own perspectives as admins + adjacent Salesforce ecosystem roles.

### March 31-April 1 Sprint Project Team Accomplishments
* Added language to the Admin Soft Skills doc on [Discovery and Requirements Gathering](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zm7H5ItAS-UZC8IVvlzNYG_ZV3QXkP4FAC-C9IILP4Q/edit#heading=h.d6zhlmlvcbk). 
* Added language to the Admin Soft Skills doc on [Writing Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zm7H5ItAS-UZC8IVvlzNYG_ZV3QXkP4FAC-C9IILP4Q/edit#heading=h.ig36o3e2d60j)
* Added language to the Admin Soft Skills doc on a new section on [the role and mindset of a Product Owner](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zm7H5ItAS-UZC8IVvlzNYG_ZV3QXkP4FAC-C9IILP4Q/edit#heading=h.wqo2w4wq4qxm)
* We got started by creating User Stories on [this Jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1zp4X2IOMyRkd_D4ZL0_sxPZrxPkT7LvF2SfPAToK2yE/viewer?f=0) and then distilled to the above three working groups.


### Future Contributions Requested
* Pick sections in the [Admin Soft Skills doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zm7H5ItAS-UZC8IVvlzNYG_ZV3QXkP4FAC-C9IILP4Q/edit) that need more content and group together to add it!
* In general, help carry this doc to be ready to be published in the near future! We're thinking this can become content on the NPSP documentation page. We also imagine taking really strong chunks of this writing to publish as blog posts.
