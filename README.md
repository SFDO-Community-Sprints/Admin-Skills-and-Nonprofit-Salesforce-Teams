### Project Name
Nonprofit Salesforce Admin Skills

### Project Goals
* Support admins + their supervisors in forming strong Salesforce teams.
* Generate and collate best practice documentation on soft skills related to this role.

(Almost all of what we're working on could be extrapolated to any Salesforce team environment, it's just that we are aiming to write from a nonprofit-specific lens to be most helpful to our community. Our next steps as a group are motivated by the needs we feel from our own perspectives as admins + adjacent Salesforce ecosystem roles.)

### Future Contributions Requested
* In general, help **complete this document** so it's ready to be published in the near future.
* **Fulfill the plan** for distribution of the document: 
    - How/When/Who will create a site home for the document and future projects of this group
    - Creation of website
    - Marketing/Promotion
* **Editing Needs** Once the document's sections are complete, editing will be necessary. In particular:
    - Removal of repetitive advice across sections (either link to another relevant section or at least copy the text in multiple places for consistency).
    - Creation of a consistent 'voice' throughout the document.

### Planned EMEA Contributions (29 June 2021)
* **Review the Google Doc** created in the AMER Sprints to check for anything that doesn't fit an EMEA context.
    - This will be done by working through a copied version of the doc to ensure no alterations are made to the AMER version.
    - After the event, this work will be reviewed in order to decide on a plan for implementing any points raised via the review.
* **Begin drafting Guidance for Employers Documentation** focusing on supporting the development/upskilling of Salesforce Admins.

### Recommended Working Format
Pick a section where you can offer expertise or extensive personal experience, and form a group of 3-6 others who feel the same. In your working group, identify one person who will be the "Synthesizer / Scribe" who will *from the very beginning of the work* be responsible for writing a well-formatted narrative or clean outline of the content you'd like to publish/share by the end of the sprint. Below that synthesized content can be a long collection of thoughts, bullet points, all kinds of material...just start at the beginning having someone keep an eye toward the end of the sprint by bringing together the highlights into a shareable format.
